# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-12)

**Core value:** Intelligent phase analysis — breaking any software project into well-structured, dependency-aware phases with correct agent assignments and parallelization
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 10 (Foundation)
Plan: 0 of 4 in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-03-12 — Roadmap created, 22 v1 requirements mapped across 10 phases

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Foundation: genai 0.5 is the unified provider client — watch for JSON mode gaps per provider (fallback: direct reqwest)
- Foundation: anyhow at binary boundary, thiserror for internal domain errors
- Foundation: Typed inter-agent schemas (PLAN-04) built in Phase 1 — prevents #1 multi-agent failure mode

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 5 (PhasePlanner): LLM-assisted DAG decomposition prompt design has no public precedent — plan for prompt iteration as versioned code artifacts
- Phase 7 (ReviewEngine): Cross-vendor review pairing effectiveness is unquantified — initial routing table is a reasonable default, monitor results
- Phase 10 (Parallel/Worktrees): git2 worktree lifecycle in async Rust context has limited documented examples
